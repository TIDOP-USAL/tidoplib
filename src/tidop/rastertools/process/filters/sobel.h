/*!
 * \brief Sobel Operator
 *
 * The Sobel operator is an edge detection operator that calculates the gradient of image intensity
 * at each pixel, giving the direction of the greatest increase in intensity. It is primarily used 
 * for edge detection in images, allowing you to highlight regions of high spatial frequency.
 *
 * ### Key Features:
 * - **Gradient Calculation:** Computes the gradient of the image intensity using Sobel kernels.
 * - **Edge Detection:** Highlights edges in an image, useful for feature extraction and object detection.
 * - **Directional Information:** The Sobel operator can compute gradients in both horizontal (x-direction)
 *   and vertical (y-direction) directions.
 *
 * ### Parameters:
 * - **dx, dy:** Determines the order of the derivative in the x and y directions.
 * - **Kernel Size (ksize):** Defines the size of the Sobel kernel used for gradient calculation.
 * - **Scale:** Scales the result by a constant factor to adjust gradient magnitude.
 * - **Delta:** Adds a constant value to the computed gradient value.
 * - **Thresholding:** After computing the gradient, the magnitude can be thresholded to focus on significant edges.
 *
 * ### Applications:
 * - **Edge Detection:** Used in many image processing applications to detect boundaries of objects.
 * - **Feature Detection:** Helps in identifying edges for feature extraction in tasks like object recognition.
 * - **Image Segmentation:** The Sobel operator can be used to delineate different regions in an image.
