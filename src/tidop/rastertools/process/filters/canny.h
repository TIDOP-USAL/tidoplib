/*!
 * \brief Canny Edge Detector
 *
 * The Canny edge detector is a widely used edge detection algorithm designed to identify 
 * edges in an image with precision. It employs a multi-step process that includes noise 
 * reduction, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, and hysteresis thresholding 
 * to produce clean and accurate edge maps.
 *
 * ### Threshold Calculation:
 * If the thresholds `threshold1` and `threshold2` are not explicitly provided during initialization, 
 * they are automatically calculated based on the mean and standard deviation of the pixel intensities 
 * in the input image. The formula for this calculation is:
 * \code
 * threshold1 = mean - stdDev;
 * threshold2 = mean + stdDev;
 * \endcode
 * where `mean` and `stdDev` are the mean and standard deviation of the pixel intensities, respectively.
 *
 * ### Applications:
 * - Object boundary detection.
 * - Feature extraction for computer vision tasks.
 * - Preprocessing for image segmentation.
