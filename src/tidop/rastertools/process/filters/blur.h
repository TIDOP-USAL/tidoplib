/*!
 * \brief Blur Filter
 *
 * The blur filter applies a simple averaging filter to the input image,
 * causing a smoothing effect. This operation reduces noise and detail,
 * resulting in a softer appearance of the image. It is one of the simplest
 * linear filters and is commonly used as a pre-processing step in computer
 * vision tasks.
 *
 * ### Parameters:
 * - \b Kernel Size (\a mKernelSize): Specifies the size of the averaging kernel.
 *   Larger kernels produce stronger smoothing effects.
 * - \b Anchor Point (\a mAnchor): Defines the point relative to the kernel that
 *   is placed over the pixel being processed. By default, this is set to (-1, -1),
 *   which means the anchor is centered.
 * - \b Border Type (\a mBorderType): Determines the method used for border extrapolation.
 *
 * ### Applications:
 * - Smoothing images to reduce noise.
 * - Pre-processing for edge detection.
 * - Reducing high-frequency content in images.
