/*!
 * \brief Bilateral Filter
 *
 * The bilateral filter is a non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing smoothing filter.
 * It replaces the intensity value at each pixel with a weighted average of the intensities of
 * nearby pixels, where the weights depend on both the spatial distance and the intensity difference.
 *
 * This filter is particularly effective for:
 * - Removing noise while preserving sharp edges in images.
 * - Applications such as denoising photographs and pre-processing for edge-detection algorithms.
 *
 * ### Parameters:
 * - \b Diameter (\a mDiameter): Specifies the diameter of the pixel neighborhood used during filtering.
 *   A larger diameter leads to stronger smoothing.
 * - \b SigmaColor (\a mSigmaColor): Controls how much influence intensity differences between pixels
 *   have on the smoothing. A higher value allows more differences in intensity to be smoothed.
 * - \b SigmaSpace (\a mSigmaSpace): Controls how much influence spatial distance between pixels has
 *   on the smoothing. A higher value results in wider smoothing in terms of distance.
 * - \b BorderType (\a mBorderType): Defines the method used for extrapolating image borders.
 *
 * The bilateral filter is computationally expensive compared to other smoothing filters like Gaussian
 * or median filters, but its ability to preserve edges makes it a preferred choice in scenarios where
 * edge information is critical.
