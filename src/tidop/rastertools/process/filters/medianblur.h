/*!
 * \brief Median Filter
 *
 * This class applies a median filter to an image, an effective method for reducing noise
 * while preserving edges. The median filter replaces each pixel's value with the median
 * value of the intensities within a neighborhood defined by the filter size.
 *
 * ### Key Features:
 * - **Noise Reduction:** Particularly effective for removing salt-and-pepper noise from images.
 * - **Edge Preservation:** Unlike linear filters, the median filter preserves edges by considering
 *   the median of the neighborhood rather than averaging pixel values.
 * - **Non-Linear Operation:** The filter relies on sorting pixel intensities within the kernel,
 *   making it robust against outliers.
 *
 * ### Filter Behavior:
 * - The size of the filter is defined by the kernel size, which must be an odd integer.
 * - Larger kernel sizes result in stronger smoothing but may introduce distortions in finer details.
 *
 * ### Applications:
 * - **Noise Removal:** Especially useful for reducing impulsive noise (salt-and-pepper noise).
 * - **Preprocessing for Image Segmentation:** Enhances image quality for better segmentation results.
 * - **Edge Preservation Smoothing:** Ideal for scenarios where edge information is critical.
