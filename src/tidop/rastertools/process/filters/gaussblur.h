 /*!
  * \brief Gaussian Blur Filter
  *
  * This class applies a Gaussian blur to an image, a widely-used technique in image processing
  * for reducing noise and detail. The Gaussian blur works by convolving the image with a Gaussian kernel,
  * resulting in a smooth, natural blur effect.
  *
  * ### How It Works:
  * The Gaussian blur filter replaces each pixel value with a weighted average of its neighboring pixels,
  * where the weights are determined by the Gaussian function:
  * \f[
  * G(x, y) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\sigma^2}}
  * \f]
  * Here, \f$\sigma\f$ represents the standard deviation, which determines the spread of the Gaussian
  * kernel and the extent of the blur.
  *
  * ### Key Features:
  * - **Custom Kernel Size:** The size of the kernel determines the area of influence for the blur.
  * - **Adjustable Sigma Values:** The standard deviations (\f$\sigma_x\f$ and \f$\sigma_y\f$) control
  *   the intensity of the blur along the X and Y axes, respectively. If \f$\sigma_y\f$ is set to 0,
  *   it will be automatically computed as equal to \f$\sigma_x\f$.
  * - **Border Handling:** Supports various extrapolation methods to manage image borders effectively,
  *   such as constant padding, replication, and mirroring.
  *
  * ### Applications:
  * - Preprocessing images to remove noise before applying edge detection or segmentation.
  * - Creating a natural depth-of-field effect in images.
  * - Smoothing textures in computer vision tasks.
