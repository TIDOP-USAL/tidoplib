/*!
 * \brief Convolution Filter
 *
 * This class applies a convolution filter to an image using a user-defined kernel. 
 * Convolution is a fundamental operation in image processing and computer vision, 
 * commonly used for tasks such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and feature extraction.
 *
 * ### How it Works:
 * The convolution operation involves sliding the kernel (a small matrix) over the image and 
 * computing the weighted sum of the pixel intensities covered by the kernel at each position. 
 * The result is stored in the corresponding pixel of the output image.
 *
 * ### Key Features:
 * - **Custom Kernel:** The user provides a kernel matrix that defines the convolution operation.
 * - **Anchor Point:** Specifies the reference point in the kernel relative to which the convolution is applied. 
 *   If not specified, the anchor defaults to the center of the kernel.
 * - **Delta Adjustment:** Allows an optional constant value to be added to each filtered pixel, useful 
 *   for biasing the result.
 * - **Depth Control:** The user can define the depth of the output image. By default, the output depth 
 *   matches the input image.
 * - **Border Handling:** Supports various extrapolation methods to deal with image borders, such as 
 *   constant, replicate, reflect, or wrap.
 *
 * ### Applications:
 * - Image smoothing (e.g., Gaussian blur).
 * - Edge detection (e.g., Sobel or Prewitt filters).
 * - Feature extraction (e.g., Gabor filters).
 * - Image enhancement (e.g., sharpening).
