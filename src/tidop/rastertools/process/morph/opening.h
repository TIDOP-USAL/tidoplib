 * \brief Morphological opening operation.
 *
 * The morphological opening operation involves performing an erosion
 * followed by a dilation on an image:
 *
 * \f[
 * Opening = Dilation(Erosion(Image))
 * \f]
 *
 * This operation is used to remove small objects or noise from an image
 * while preserving the shape and size of larger objects. It is particularly
 * effective for removing bright noise (foreground elements smaller than the
 * structuring element) from binary or grayscale images. Opening is often used
 * in preprocessing for object detection and segmentation tasks.

    /*!
     * \brief Constructor for the Opening class.
     *
     * Initializes the opening operation with the specified parameters.
     *
     * \param[in] size Size of the structuring element. Determines the scale of objects
     *                 that will be removed during erosion.
     * \param[in] type Type of the structuring element (e.g., rectangle, ellipse, cross).
     *                 Defines the shape of the kernel used in the operation.
     * \param[in] anchor Anchor point within the kernel. By default, it is set to the
     *                   center of the structuring element (-1, -1).
     * \param[in] iterations Number of times the opening operation is applied. Increasing
     *                       iterations can amplify the effect of noise removal.
     * \param[in] borderType Method for extrapolating border pixels outside the image boundary.
     *                       Common options include constant borders or reflected edges.
     * \param[in] borderValue Value assigned to border pixels if the border type is set to constant.
