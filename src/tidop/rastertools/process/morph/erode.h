 * \brief Morphological erosion operation.
 *
 * This operation shrinks the bright regions (or foreground) in a binary or grayscale image.
 * Morphological erosion reduces the size of objects by convolving the image with a structuring
 * element (kernel). It removes small bright noise, disconnects connected objects, or emphasizes
 * darker features in the image.
 *
 * Erosion is particularly useful for tasks such as reducing noise, separating connected objects,
 * and shrinking features to analyze their structure. The extent of erosion depends on the size,
 * shape, and number of iterations of the structuring element.

     * \brief Constructor for the Erotion class.
     *
     * Initializes the erosion operation with the specified parameters.
     *
     * \param[in] size Size of the structuring element. Determines the area of influence for erosion.
     * \param[in] type Type of the structuring element (e.g., rectangle, ellipse, cross).
     *                 Defines the shape of the kernel.
     * \param[in] anchor Anchor point within the kernel. By default, it is set to the center
     *                   of the structuring element (-1, -1).
     * \param[in] iterations Number of times the erosion operation is applied.
     *                       Higher values lead to greater shrinking of features.
     * \param[in] borderType Method for extrapolating border pixels outside the image boundary.
     *                       Common options include constant borders or reflected edges.
     * \param[in] borderValue Value assigned to border pixels if the border type is set to constant.
