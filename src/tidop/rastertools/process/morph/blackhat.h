 * \brief Morphological Black Hat operation
 *
 * This operation highlights dark regions in an image that are surrounded by lighter areas.
 * It is performed by applying a morphological closing operation (dilation followed by erosion)
 * to the input image and then subtracting the result from the original image.
 *
 * The Black Hat operation is commonly used in image processing to extract specific features,
 * such as dark objects, shadows, or imperfections in brighter regions, making it useful
 * for tasks like document analysis or defect detection.
