 * \brief Morphological gradient operation.
 *
 * The morphological gradient computes the difference between the dilation
 * and erosion of an image:
 *
 * \f[
 * Gradient = Dilation - Erosion
 * \f]
 *
 * This operation emphasizes the edges or boundaries of objects in the image
 * by highlighting the transition regions between foreground and background.
 * It is particularly useful in edge detection, feature extraction, and image
 * segmentation tasks. The result of the gradient operation is an image that
 * represents the thickness of object boundaries.

    /*!
     * \brief Constructor for the Gradient class.
     *
     * Initializes the gradient operation with the specified parameters.
     *
     * \param[in] size Size of the structuring element. Determines the area of influence for the gradient.
     * \param[in] type Type of the structuring element (e.g., rectangle, ellipse, cross). Defines the shape
     *                 of the kernel.
     * \param[in] anchor Anchor point within the kernel. By default, it is set to the center of the structuring
     *                   element (-1, -1).
     * \param[in] iterations Number of times the gradient operation is applied. A higher number of iterations
     *                       may lead to thicker boundary regions.
     * \param[in] borderType Method for extrapolating border pixels outside the image boundary. Common options
     *                       include constant borders or reflected edges.
     * \param[in] borderValue Value assigned to border pixels if the border type is set to constant.
