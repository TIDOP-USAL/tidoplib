 * \brief Morphological dilation operation.
 *
 * This operation expands the bright regions (or foreground) in a binary or grayscale image.
 * Morphological dilation increases the size of objects by convolving the image with a
 * structuring element (kernel). It is commonly used to fill small holes, connect disjoint objects,
 * or emphasize features in an image.
 *
 * Dilation is especially useful in tasks such as image segmentation, feature enhancement,
 * or noise removal. The degree of expansion depends on the size, shape, and number of iterations
 * specified for the structuring element.

     * \brief Constructor for the Dilate operation.
     *
     * Initializes the dilation operation with the specified parameters.
     *
     * \param[in] size Size of the structuring element. Determines the area of influence for dilation.
     * \param[in] type Type of the structuring element (e.g., rectangle, ellipse, cross).
     *                 Defines the shape of the kernel.
     * \param[in] anchor Anchor point within the kernel. By default, it is set to the center
     *                   of the structuring element (-1, -1).
     * \param[in] iterations Number of times the dilation operation is applied.
     *                       Higher values lead to greater expansion of features.
     * \param[in] borderType Method for extrapolating border pixels outside the image boundary.
     *                       Common options include constant borders or reflected edges.
     * \param[in] borderValue Value assigned to border pixels if the border type is set to constant.
