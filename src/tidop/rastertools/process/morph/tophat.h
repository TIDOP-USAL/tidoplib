 * \brief Morphological Top Hat operation.
 *
 * The Top Hat operation computes the difference between an image and the result
 * of applying a morphological opening operation to the same image:
 *
 * \f[
 * TopHat = Image - Opening(Image)
 * \f]
 *
 * This operation is useful for highlighting small, bright elements or regions in an
 * image that are smaller than the structuring element used in the opening. It can be
 * applied to tasks such as enhancing fine details, detecting small objects, or
 * preprocessing images for further analysis.

     * \brief Constructor for the TopHat class.
     *
     * Initializes the Top Hat operation with the specified parameters.
     *
     * \param[in] size Size of the structuring element. Determines the scale of elements
     *                 to be highlighted in the image.
     * \param[in] type Type of the structuring element (e.g., rectangle, ellipse, cross).
     *                 Defines the shape of the kernel used in the operation.
     * \param[in] anchor Anchor point within the kernel. By default, it is set to the
     *                   center of the structuring element (-1, -1).
     * \param[in] iterations Number of times the Top Hat operation is applied. Increasing
     *                       iterations can accentuate the highlighting effect.
     * \param[in] borderType Method for extrapolating border pixels outside the image boundary.
     *                       Common options include constant borders or reflected edges.
     * \param[in] borderValue Value assigned to border pixels if the border type is set to constant.
