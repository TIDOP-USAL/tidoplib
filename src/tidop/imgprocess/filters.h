/*! \defgroup Filters Image Filters
 *
 * Types of filters:
 *
 * - Smoothing
 * - Enhancement
 * - Noise reduction
 * - Edge detection
 *
 * <h3>Low-pass filters (image smoothing)</h3>
 *
 * - Mean filter: replaces each pixel with the average value of its neighbors
 * - Median filter: replaces with the median value of neighboring pixels (usually performs better than the mean filter).
 * - Gaussian filter: approximation to the Gaussian distribution.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Image enhancement filters</h3>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Noise reduction filters:</h3>
 *
 * Noise is random variation in brightness or color in digital images produced by the input device.
 *
 * <h4>Types of noise:</h4>
 *
 * - Impulse Noise or "Salt and Pepper": pixels in the image are very different in color or intensity from surrounding pixels. Generally, this type of noise affects a small number of pixels in the image.
 * - Gaussian Noise: In Gaussian noise, each and every pixel making up the image is affected according to a normal or Gaussian distribution.
 * - Uniform Noise: Takes values in a certain interval equiprobably. It occurs in fewer real-life situations.
 *
 * <h3>Edge detection filters</h3>
